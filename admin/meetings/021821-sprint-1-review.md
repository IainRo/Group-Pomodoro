### Meeting Notes:

Jordan:
Need to discuss Unit Testing
ADRs

ADR - info for each task needed

Megan:
Finished up how to page with redirect buttons to landing page and setup page

Tommy:
Basic functionalities of the active and settings page are done. CI/CD pipeline is fine.
As a group we decided to drop the settings page and join it with the set up page. 
Moving forward, I now work along with Ari on the set up page, need to make unit tests, and need to improve the pipeline.

Jiahong:
Reviewed PR and kept up with relevant issues regarding page under my ownership
Kept updated with ongoing ADRs such as common CSS conventions and interfacing with local storage

Iain: 
Finished up core structure to the landing page, included buttons that link to set up, how to page, and settings page.
Along with the team, need to remove the settings button, and finish the overall layout for the landing page, finish off the minor details.

Brian:
Worked on the results page and finished it with all functionality needed. Uses localstorage to pull the completed tasks and task data, then displays it on the page. 
Discussed how we're going to handle normalizing CSS across the web page and started looking at and writing unit tests for pages. 
Moving forward, will polish up remaining pages and work on writing robust tests to handle all cases.
